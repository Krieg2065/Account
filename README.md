<p>Hi there! My name is Krieg2065 and I am a software developer with 2 years of experience working with the Angular and Flask frameworks 💻. I am currently learning Docker 🐳 as I believe it is a valuable skill to have in the modern software development world.</p>

<p>I am proficient in several programming languages including Python 🐍, TypeScript 💎, Java 💻, and JavaScript 🕸. I enjoy working on projects that involve full-stack development, and I am always looking to expand my knowledge and skills in this field 🚀.</p>
